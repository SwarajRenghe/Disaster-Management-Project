			      <p style="font-size: 19px"> All three of the team members have been working with LTRC lab for our honors project, hence we chose a project that can best exploit our skillset. We feel like we can use some NLP techniques like sentiment analysis, semantic word disambiguation and other techniques to better collaborate between volunteer groups, to better understand local situations and to provide immediate support to affected individuals. </p>

			      <p> <b> Challenge One </b> </p>
			      <p style="font-size:19px"> <b> Lack of Means of Reliable Communication </b> </p>
			      <p> Immediately following a disaster, most means of communication like phone networks and internet service providers will be non-operational. </p>
			    </div>
			    <div class="tile is-child box">
			      <p> <b> Challenge Two </b> </p>
			      <p style="font-size:19px"> <b> Spread of Fake News </b> </p>
			      <p> In the aftermath of a disaster, there’s rampant spread of fake and propaganda news spread on social media, that can have adverse effects on relief efforts, and people’s morale. </p>

			    <div class="tile is-child box">
			      <p> <b> Challenge Three </b> </p>
			      <p style="font-size:19px"> <b> Awareness about Disasters </b> </p>
			      <p> Given social media content, like tweets or FB posts, this challenge is about recognizing which of them are talking about a disaster event that took place, using AI. </p>

			      		<p style="font-size:28px"> <b> Disaster Tweet Identification </b> </p>
			      		<p> Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The iniquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, disaster relief organizations and news agencies are interested in programmatically monitoring Twitter. Unfortunately, it’s usually a difficult task to correctly identify a valid disaster tweet.</p><br>

			      		<p style="font-size:28px"> <b> Fake News Classifier  </b> </p>
			      		<p> The unmoderated nature of sites such as Twitter can create a rumor mill among users. When false information is maliciously or mistakenly spread on social media sites it can result in millions of misinformed users. Over the last decade, there has been an overwhelming amount of cases where false news spreads during crisis events, such as natural disasters and terrorist attacks. We will try to build a method of a lookup on reputed new sources to verify or refute claims made, and classify them as fake or real. </p> <br>

			      		<p style="font-size:28px"> <b> Mesh Broadcast Network  </b> </p>
			      		<p> In mesh networks, messages bypass the internet by using protocols that allow devices to talk to each other – eg. Bluetooth or an Ad Hoc wifi network running on the device. The idea of localised communication that needs no external infrastructure is very useful during disasters that might destroy existing cell towers and underground cables cutting off people from accessing new information about the disaster. A light weight app might be built to allow communication during disasters and to allow the government to direct citizens to safety and provide relief and information about rescue.</p>
