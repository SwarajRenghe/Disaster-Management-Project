			      	<p> For this architecture, we tried a number of different standard machine learning algorithms, and tried some voting methods between the highest performing ones too. <br> The data would first be streamed into a pre-processing. This is standard NLP preprocessing steps like stop word removal and and lemmatisation. <br>
			      	Then for feature representation too, we went through and tried a variety of techniques like DoctoVec, WordtoVec and weighted averaging between Text content and Title content. We also did PCA on vectors after Tf-IDF vectorisation. We did hyper parameter tuing on these different feature representations. <br><br> For Classification we tried the following algorithms: <li> SVM </li> <li> Random Forest </li> <li> Logistic Regression </li><li> XGBoost </li><li> Multi-Layer Perceptron  <br><br></li></p>

			      <p> The dataset used has collected news from various major publications, including the New York Times, Breitbart, CNN, Business Insider, the Atlantic etc. The data primarily falls between the years of 2016 and July 2017.  It had over 140,000 articles form 15 major publications.
			      	<br>
			      For Fake News, we used another dataset that was sourced from several known fake news sources, and websites. 
			      <br><br>
			  		The data contains various metadata about each article, such as publication source,author, date,title etc. All of this information is used during the feature extraction step.

	   		      			      The US claimed it had conducted a “counter-terrorism” strike against Islamic State (IS) fighters when it hit Nangarhar province with missiles on September 28. But the next day the United Nations issued an unusually rapid and strong statement saying the strike had killed 15 civilians and injured 13 others who had gathered at a house to celebrate a tribal elder’s return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. 
	   		      			      The Bureau spoke to a man named Haji Rais who said he was the owner of the house that was targeted. He said 15 people were killed and 19 others injured, and provided their names (listed below). The Bureau was able to independently verify the identities of those who died. 
	   		      			      Rais’ son, a headmaster at a local school, was among them. Another man, Abdul Hakim, lost three of his sons in the attack. 
	   		      			      Rais said he had no involvement with IS and denied US claims that IS members had visited his house before the strike. He said: “I did not even speak to those sort of people on the phone let alone receiving them in my house.”

[Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy, liberal Wellesley, Massachusetts. Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress.  Speaking of Great Expectations, Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class. The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed “no debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be” (kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school). “I am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us —  the 400 of us,” Miss Rodham told her classmates. After appointing herself Edger Bergen to the Charlie McCarthys and Mortimer Snerds in attendance, the    bespectacled in granny glasses (awarding her matronly wisdom —  or at least John Lennon wisdom) took issue with the previous speaker. Despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the U. S. Senate since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke came in for criticism for calling for “empathy” for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics. Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented “Black Power demagogues” and “elitist arrogance and repressive intolerance” within the New Left, similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal. “Trust,” Rodham ironically observed in 1969, “this is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said ‘Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others.
